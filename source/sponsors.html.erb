      <p><strong>Bytemark Hosting</strong> Bytemark is the UK's smartest hosting company for builders and self-starters, established in 2002. It has its own data centre in York, another in Manchester, and its own cloud hosting platform called BigV (70,000 lines of Ruby). BigV lets developers scale to servers of up to 180GB of RAM, and to mix in dedicated servers for the most flexible hosting network. Bytemark can also take on active management of applications and clients, including all the fiddly stuff like backups, health monitoring and 24-hour response.
